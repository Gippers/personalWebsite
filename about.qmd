I’m a data scientist/analyst with over five years of industry experience. I turn messy, complex data into insights that help make better decisions. I’ve worked across all stages of the analytics lifecycle including planning analysis, wrangling complex administrative datasets, analyzing and modelling data, and finally presenting results in a clear, easy to understand way. I strive to deliver insights that genuinely improve outcomes.
