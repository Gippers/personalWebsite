I’m a well-rounded data scientist with over five years of experience. I turn messy, complex data into insights that actually help people make better decisions. I’ve worked across the full analytics lifecycle from shaping research questions and pulling together tricky administrative datasets, to analysing and modelling data, and finally presenting results in a clear, easy to understand way. I aim to deliver insights that genuinely improve outcomes.

You can look at some of my personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gippers>).
